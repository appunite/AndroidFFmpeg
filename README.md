# AndroidFFmpegLibrary
This project aims to create **working** library providing playing video files in android via ffmpeg libraries. With some effort and NDK knowledge you can use this ffmpeg libraries build to convert video files.
We rather want to use ffmpeg library without modifications to facilitate updating of ffmpeg core.

This project aim to simplify compilation of FFmpeg for android different architectures to one big apk file.

I'm afraid this project is not prepared for android beginners - build it and using it requires some NDK skills.

## Installation

### Go to the work
downloading source code 

	git clone https://review.appunite.com/androidffmpeg AndroidFFmpeg
	cd AndroidFFmpeg
	git submodule init
	git submodule sync #if you are updating source code
	git submodule update
	cd library-jni
	cd jni

download libyuv and configure libs

	./fetch.sh

build external libraries
Download r8e ndk: https://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r8e-darwin-x86_64.tar.bz2 or
ttps://dl.google.com/android/ndk/android-ndk-r8e-linux-x86_64.tar.bz2

	export NDK=/your/path/to/android-ndk
	./build_android.sh
	
make sure that files library-jni/jni/ffmpeg-build/{armeabi,armeabi-v7a,x86}/libffmpeg.so was created, otherwise you are in truble


build ndk jni library (in `library-jni` directory)

	export PATH="${PATH}:${NDK}"
	ndk-build

make sure that files library-jni/libs/{armeabi,armeabi-v7a,x86}/libffmpeg.so was created, otherwise you are in truble

build your project

	./gradlew build

## More codecs
If you need more codecs:
- edit build_android.sh
- add more codecs in ffmpeg configuration section
- remove old ffmpeg-build directory by

		rm -r ffmpeg-build
	
- build ffmpeg end supporting libraries

		./build_android.sh
		
	During this process make sure that ffmpeg configuration goes without error.
	
	After build make sure that files FFmpegLibrary/jni/ffmpeg-build/{armeabi,armeabi-v7a,x86}/libffmpeg.so was created, otherwise you are in truble

- build your ndk library

		ndk-build

- refresh your FFmpegLibrary project in eclipse!!!!
- build your FFmpegExample project
